browser router -> context provider


the structure is something like -> 

<BrowserRouter>
<Routes> 
 <Route>
</Routes>
</BrowserRouter>


MPA vs SPA -> 
<header>
 <main content> 
 <footer>

in SPAs, main content gets changed avoiding the page from getting refreshed

<Route path="" element ={} />


to use css on <link> 
treat it as an anchor tag

a {
  text-decoration: none;
} for no underline


miragejs -> used to mock a server


nested Routes

<Route>
  <Route/>
  <Route/>
</Route>
